# Raspberry Pi touchscreen stop motion animation

This project is an attempt to build a very simple and easy to use stop
motion application for the Raspberry Pi touchscreen. A fair bit of the
values here are hard coded for a 800x480 display.

Pygame is used to draw the screen. It's not pretty, but it mostly works.
